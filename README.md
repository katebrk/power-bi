# Power BI Portfolio Projects

Hello! I'm Kate and this repository is a place to share my Power BI portfolio projects. 

I enjoy creating simple, consistent, and user-friendly reports that follow core data visualization and analysis principles. I also aim to build a clean and well-structured backend - data models / semantic layer, DAX measures, transfomations. Find my reports below!
